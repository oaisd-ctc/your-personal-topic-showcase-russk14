The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4" /50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force.
The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber gu.
and included 12 centerline torpedo
tubes.
The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely toits increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 duat purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the elass added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement.
The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5°/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations.
The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's
WW1 fleet. A fast and capable elass, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force,
The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6* guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy.
The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions, The Cleveland Cla as keeps the 12 6" main sun arrangement, but increased its secondary S" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry,
The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure.


The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8* /55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable, It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force,
The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5*/38 guns.
The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita.
Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers.
The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14° /45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5*/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor.
The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16" /45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers.
The lowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The lowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind.
The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser.
Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers.
The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection.


The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations.

The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up.
As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs.
With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large complement of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling.
The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle).

The Yorktown Class carriers were a pivotal step in the evolution of US naval aviation, designed to strike a balance between speed, firepower, and endurance. Built in response to growing global tensions and lessons from earlier classes, the Yorktown Class incorporated enhanced damage control systems and a larger air group, all while maintaining high speed for rapid deployment. These carriers would go on to play key roles in the Pacific Theater, proving their worth in both offensive operations and their ability to absorb damage, setting the standard for future carrier designs.
