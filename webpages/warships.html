                    Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and
                    included

                    While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an

                    The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5Â°/38 caliber guns and a much larger

The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4" /50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force.
tubes.
The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's
WW1 fleet. A fast and capable elass, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force,




The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8* /55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable, It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force,
The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5*/38 guns.
The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita.
Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers.
The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14Â° /45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5*/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor.
The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16" /45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers.
The lowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The lowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind.
The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser.
Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers.
The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection.




The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up.
